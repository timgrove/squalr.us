I took inspiration from [Isaac Hepworth](https://github.com/hepwori/wwi) and [Kelly Shalk](https://kellymcshalk.medium.com/expectation-setting-on-a-virtual-team-2d64f3e7ed8a) to create my own "working with" document. At first glance this is a handy tool to share "how I work" but it can describe so much more.

Already an intersection between my work and personal life, GitHub felt like the appropriate place for this information to live. Even further, it felt appropriate to utilize [GitHub's profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) to share these details and essentially make it my GitHub bio.

## About me

It's easy, especially during a pandemic when everyone is remote, to forget that we are all people working together. Adding some information about who you are, your family, interests, and hobbies can make it available to all.

Sharing communications preferences (both time and medium) can help set expectations with coworkers. Finally, sharing values and passions can help communicate where your priorities and expectations lay.

Conclusion

Writing out my "working with" was a great exercise and really made me think about what I was writing down.



It felt appropriate to utilize [GitHub's profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) to share details about me both personally and professionally.
